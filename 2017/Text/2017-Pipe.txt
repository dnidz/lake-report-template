Overview='''
*Thank you to Tom Sullivan, the volunteer monitor for Pipe Lake*

The key takeaways from the 2017 monitoring season are:
* Pipe Lake continues to be oligotrophic, with clear water, low nutrient concentrations, and low algal growth.
* Pipe Lake has one of the deepest Secchi depths (clearest water) of any lake in the Lake Stewardship program. Secchi depths have been getting even deeper over time.
* No algal blooms were reported in 2017.

The Lake Stewardship Program recommends continued monitoring of Pipe Lake.

Trends='''
The trend of deeper Secchi depths (clearer water) in Pipe Lake is especially noticeable. On average, Secchi depths in recent years have been about 1.5 m deeper than they were in the mid-1990s when monitoring began.

TSI='''
In recent years, the three TSI values have been in the oligotrphic range, or near the oligotrophic-mesotrophic boundary.
