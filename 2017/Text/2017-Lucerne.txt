Overview='''
*Thank you to Jay Adams and Milo Dullum, the primary and backup volunteer monitors for Lake Lucerne.*

The key takeaways from the 2017 monitoring season are:
* Lake Lucerne continues to be oligotrophic-mesotrophic, with clear water, low nutrient concentrations, and low algal growth.
* Secchi depths have gotten deeper (clearer water) over time.
* No algal blooms were reported on Lake Lucerne in 2017.
